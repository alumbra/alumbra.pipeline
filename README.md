# alumbra.ring

This library provides a Ring handler implementation for GraphQL query execution.
It uses pluggable components that consume/produce data structures as described
in [alumbra.spec][alumbra-spec].

[alumbra-spec]: https://github.com/alumbra/alumbra.spec

## Usage

Don't use it yet â€“ but here's the vision:

```clojure
(require '[alumbra.ring :as graphql-ring])

(def app
  (graphql-ring/handler
    {:schema   "type Person { ... } ..."
     :context  (fn [request] (read-auth request))
     :executor (fn [context canonical-operation] ...)}))

(defonce server
  (start-server #'app {:port 8080}))
```
